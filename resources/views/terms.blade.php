            <ol type="a">
                <li>The materials on SMSBleu's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. SMSBleu makes no warranties,

                    implied
                    warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement
                    of

                <li>Further, SMSBleu does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely
